Second parametrization, it is working fine, seems is stable. Main difference with the previous one is
this doesnt have a molecule of water. However during simulations the hidratation of the ion mimics
the complex with water (encougaring). The complex already has glycans as in the pdb. Already minmized with
sander. Ready to go for MD production
