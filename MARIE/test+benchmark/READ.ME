Here some test systems to test the AWS 

1. Contains a ready to run .tpr file 


2. Include the compilation of a .tpr file with custom librairies


3. 100 ps simulation on a dummy cov-2 system


4.  RBD system + stapled peptide + fluorophore  + sugar + PMX forcefield (no PMX)
	1 short system for benchmark 
		
	run : gmx -quiet mdrun -s md.tpr -v  -nice 0 -c md.gro -ntmpi 1  -gpu_id 0 -nt $number_CPU

	please run 2 simulations to start with :
	   - one with maximum available number of CPU 
	   - one with maximum available number of CPU -2 

	If the second simulation is faster/same speed than the first keep decreasing until you reach the optimum speed 


	2 & 3 to be ran with the optimum number of CPU, They will be longer simulations
