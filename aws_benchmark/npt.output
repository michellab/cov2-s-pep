Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.1#
Reading file eq.tpr, VERSION 2019.6 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.157

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 2 OpenMP threads 

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
