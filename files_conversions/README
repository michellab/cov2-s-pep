* With Sugars:
Warning: No residues in chain starting at UYB686 identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.

Warning: No residues in chain starting at 4YB687 identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.

Warning: No residues in chain starting at VMB688 identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.

Warning: No residues in chain starting at 2MA689 identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.

Warning: No residues in chain starting at 0YB690 identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.

The topology folder doesn't contain these sugars
Need a topology that has all the sugars too!

*  Without sugars: 

Had to add TER after the end of each residue 685, since gromacs interpreted the pdb as one chain and there were issues. 

> BioSimSpace code:

import BioSimSpace as BSS 
BSS.setVerbose(True) 
files = ["nosugar.gro", "topol.top"]                                                         
system = BSS.IO.readMolecules(files, property_map={"GROMACS_PATH" : "/home/sofia/Desktop/COVID19-study/test_fragments_separately/fragments/top"}) 
BSS.IO.saveMolecules("no_sugar", system, ["rst7", "prm7»])

> ParmEd code: 
from parmed import gromacs 
gromacs.GROMACS_TOPDIR = "/home/sofia/Desktop/COVID19-study/test_fragments_separately/fragments/top"

from parmed.gromacs import GROMACS_TOPDIR
GROMACS_TOPDIR = "/home/sofia/Desktop/COVID19-study/test_fragments_separately/fragments/top" 

import parmed as pmd 
gmx_top = pmd.load_file('topol.top',xyz='nosugar.gro') 
gmx_top.save('pmd_no_sugar.prm7', format='amber') 
gmx_top.save('pmd_no_sugar.rst7', format='rst7') 

Both BSS and pmd worked but pmd’s output couldn’t be visualised with VMD

—> If topology is written with gmx pdb2gmx then the file conversions work as well
